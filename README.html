<h2>A general parser in C</h2>
<p>This is a system for building a parser (in C) for any programming
language. It uses a simple but effective parsing algorithm, is
acceptably fast (the ALGOL 60 parser supplied as an example parsed
the largest ALGOL 60 program I've been able to find in under
a second on my 10-yr old 686 (when compiled using clang and the 'fast' options),
which included generating a reformatted
version of the input file from the parse tree). The grammars are
  easy to write and a skeleton compiler source is built for you.
  Unicode input is supported in both the user's programs and in the
grammar definition itself.</p>
<p>(If you have previous experience with the unix systems yacc or bison and their lexers lex and flex,
  this parser is easier to use: there are no 'shift-reduce' conflicts to resolve, there is arbitrary lookahead,
  and lexing is built-in to the parser which is capable of matching terminals against regular expressions.
'Scannerless parsing' is supported and old-style 'line reconstruction' can be done if needed.)</p>
<p>The file you are currently reading is <a href="http://gtoal.com/languages/algol60/new-unicode-parser/README.html">http://gtoal.com/languages/algol60/new-unicode-parser/README.html</a> and
the associated files are all available at <a href="http://gtoal.com/languages/algol60/new-unicode-parser/">http://gtoal.com/languages/algol60/new-unicode-parser/</a></p>
<h3>How to use it - the short version</h3>
<ul>
<li>Create a working directory somewhere and <tt>cd</tt> into
it.</li>
<li>Fetch the code: <tt>wget
<a href="http://www.gtoal.com/languages/algol60/new-unicode-parser/algol60.tar">http://www.gtoal.com/languages/algol60/new-unicode-parser/algol60.tar</a></tt><br>

<tt>tar -xvf algol60.tar</tt></li>
<li>Build the executable: <tt>make</tt></li>
<li>run the regression tests for the example supplied: <tt>./REGRESSION.sh</tt></li>
</ul>
Then when you want to try a grammar of your own:
<ul>
<li>Create your own <tt><em>language</em>.g</tt> grammar and <tt>test.<em>language</em></tt> input file.</li>
<li>Create your new project by using <tt>./build-parser.sh <em>language</em></tt> once.</li>
<li>Build the new project by typing: <tt>make</tt></li>
<li>Test your new project with <tt>./<em>language</em> test.<em>language</em></tt></li>
</ul>
<p>(Note: the use of specific file extensions in this description
is arbitrary - the utilities are agnostic to the actual extension
  used.)</p>

The demonstration parser builds an executable, "<tt>algol60</tt>", which will
re-indent an Algol60 source file (such as the examples in <tt>test/*.a60</tt>)
while canonicalizing some of the alternative Algol symbols to something
approaching the <em>publication syntax</em> standard, with stropped keywords
having been converted to underlined format.  You can compile the canonical
Algol60 program by piping it through the <tt>unicode_to_jff</tt> utility in
the <tt>tools/</tt> subdirectory, and feeding that to the <tt>jff-a2c</tt>
compiler from <tt><a href="https://github.com/JvanKatwijk/algol-60-compiler">https://github.com/JvanKatwijk/algol-60-compiler</a></tt>.
<h3>The grammar files</h3>
<p>In the description below, I assume the reader is already
familiar with the overall concept of parsing to some extent, and
perhaps has previously used other parsing tools.</p>
<p>The grammar files used by this code are very similar to classic
Backus-Naur Form (BNF). The actual format is <a href="https://gtoal.com/history.dcs.ed.ac.uk/archive/languages/ERCC-IMP-grammars/imptocps">inherited from various
parsers written in Edinburgh in the 70's</a> and those in turn were
derived from <a href="https://gtoal.com/history.dcs.ed.ac.uk/archive/languages/atlas-autocode/Phrase_Structure-Brooker-Morris.pdf">Tony Brooker's parsers</a> from the 60's, including his
Compiler-Compiler system, so the syntax is not exactly BNF but is
very close. The grammar can be written as a stand-alone <tt>.g</tt>
file or it can be embedded in your compiler source code in the
tradition (but not the syntax) of Yacc etc. The embedded version
makes use of comments in the C code: any text found in a line
containing <tt>//\\</tt> is extracted and written to a grammar file
by the <tt>Makefile</tt> before building the parser.</p>
Note: The entire sequence beginning with <tt>P&lt;PHRASE_NAME&gt;
=</tt> is called a <em>production rule</em> or more commonly just a
<em>rule</em>. The components of a rule are either <em>phrases</em>
or <em>terminals</em> (sometimes abbreviated to <em>term</em>
although I try to avoid that word in documentation because TERM
also has another meaning in the context of parsing. Occasionally I
may slip and refer to a <em>phrase</em> as a <em>term</em> but the
reader should consider either word to be equivalent and to
represent a single unit on the right-hand side of a grammar rule.)
All rules must be terminated by a semi-colon (';'). Names in this
system are case sensitive. Both upper and lower case are allowed in
phrase names, and are considered different. The '-' character is
allowed within a phrase name, and is converted to '_' internally.
<p>I'll illustrate the different kinds of grammar rule by
example:<br></p>
<pre>        P&lt;EXACT-MATCH&gt; = "string";</pre>
This rule, used for literal text and keywords for example, has to
match the text in the source file exactly. (There's more that needs
to be said in the context of keywords for stropped languages, but
that will be added to a later revision of this document. For now
we'll handle stropped languages such as ALGOL 60 by insisting that
the keywords are actually underlined using Unicode characters and
that they can be parsed like ordinary text.)
<pre>        P&lt;BOTH&gt; = &lt;TERM&gt; &lt;ANOTHER-TERM&gt;;</pre>
For this rule to match text, the source file must contain a
<tt>TERM</tt> followed by an <tt>ANOTHER-TERM</tt>.
<pre>        P&lt;EITHER&gt; = &lt;SOME-TERM&gt;, &lt;ALTERNATIVE-TERM&gt;;</pre>
The comma between these rules means that the either
<tt>SOME-TERM</tt> has to be present in the source text, or
<tt>ALTERNATIVE-TERM</tt> has to be present. If neither are
present, the entire rule for <tt>EITHER</tt> fails.
<p>The list of phrases between commas is referred to as an
<em>Alternative</em> or an <em>Alt</em> for short.</p>
<!--  <h4>White space</h4> -->
<p>It is an option that the programmer must specify in their source
code as to whether white space is generally allowed before phrases
or terminals. (At some point this option will likely become
something that can be specified in the grammar file.) If white
space is permitted, it is included in the matched text that is
returned to the programmer, though it is very simple for the
programmer to eliminate that white space from the returned tokens &ndash;
or canonicalise the text in some other way &ndash; before using the text.
Precise details will be added in a later revision of this
document.</p>
<p>Phrases within an alternative must <em>all</em> match for the
alternative to match; if one phrase fails (say the 3rd item in an
alternative that consists of 10 phrases or terminals), then that
whole alternative fails and the next alternative is examined
instead. If all alternatives fail, the entire rule fails. Note that
this parses a language in a <em>slightly</em> different way from a
full backtracking parser in the details of where the backtracking
resumes from. This parsing algorithm is essentially the same as
that used by PEG parsers (PEG = Parsing Expression Grammar)
although it predates it by 45 years. Unlike packrat PEG parsers we
don't memoize the parsing function (although that could trivially
be added, and indeed was done in some experimental parsers in the
90's) because the programmer normally crafts the grammar so that
significant backtracking is not needed.</p>
<pre>        P&lt;REGULAR-EXPRESSION&gt; = &#171;[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9]*&#187;;</pre>
The text in the source file must match the regular expression
contained between the guillemets. Terminal matching with regular
expressions is a relatively recent addition to Edinburgh-style
parsers: historically, the compiler writers would either construct
an equivalent recogniser using grammar rules, or &ndash; more likely &ndash;
would implement an <em>ad-hoc</em> recogniser using a <em>built-in
phrase</em>. (The regular expression facility was first added in my
TACC parser in the late 80's while I was working at Acorn.)
<pre>        P&lt;EITHER_or_nothing&gt; = &lt;SOME-TERM&gt;,  &lt;ALTERNATIVE-TERM&gt;, ;</pre>
Note the ',' just before the ';' at the end of the rule. This
denotes a null rule. (You could specify this as <tt>""</tt> or
several other forms of empty string, but simply leaving a blank
alternative is the conventional way to add a null option.) A null
option always parses successfully. It is helpful but not required
to name rules that terminate in a null option with a consistent
suffix, for example <tt>_opt</tt>:
<pre>        P&lt;EITHER_opt&gt; = &lt;SOME-TERM&gt;,  &lt;ALTERNATIVE-TERM&gt;, ;</pre>
<p>(There are other terminal constructs available such as
<tt>'x'</tt> for a single 8-bit ASCII character, but these are not
really necessary and will likely be removed. It was once believed
they were necessary for performance but that turned out not to be
the case.)</p>
<p>Note that due to the combination of rules being tested in order,
and entire alternatives failing if one component of an alternative
fails, it is important to order any rules where one rule may match
the prefix of another rule - the longer rule must be given first,
for example, the following would not work as you might
expect:<br></p>
<pre>
        P&lt;BOOL&gt; = &lt;NAME&gt; &lt;COMPARE&gt; &lt;NAME&gt;;
        P&lt;COMPARE&gt; = "==", "!=", "&lt;", "&gt;", "&lt;=", "&gt;=";
      </pre>
In this rule, the <tt>&lt;</tt> is tested first, and if the
<em>parent</em> rule fails because the <tt>&lt;</tt> was not
followed by a variable, then the <tt>&lt;=</tt> terminal will never
be tested. This rule can be made to work by re-writing as follows:
<pre>
        P&lt;BOOL&gt; = &lt;NAME&gt; &lt;COMPARE&gt; &lt;NAME&gt;;
        P&lt;COMPARE&gt; = "==", "!=", "&lt;=", "&gt;=", "&lt;", "&gt;";
      </pre>
In some circumstances, the problematic matching prefix occurs several
levels distant from the failing grammar rule and knowing where to
correct the problem by reordering rules may prove difficult. In such an
instance we have an alternative fix: we call for a guard.
<h4>Guards, guards!</h4>
<p>There are two modifiers that can be applied to any
<tt>&lt;PHRASE&gt;</tt> to modify the parsing rules. These
modifiers are called &lsquo;guards&rsquo; because they guard a rule from being
executed if some condition is not met:<br></p>
<pre>        P&lt;BOTH&gt; = &lt;?GUARD-TERM&gt; &lt;ACTUAL-TERM&gt;;</pre>
In this case, the term which will be matched, and cause the text to
be accepted by the parser, is in fact <tt>ACTUAL-TERM</tt>, but
before <tt>ACTUAL-TERM</tt> can be accepted, a test is made for
<tt>GUARD-TERM</tt>. <tt>GUARD-TERM</tt> must match the following
input (which may match only the first few characters of
<tt>ACTUAL-TERM</tt> &ndash; or it may include <tt>ACTUAL-TERM</tt> and
many characters beyond it) but anything which matches
<tt>GUARD-TERM</tt> is <em>not</em> removed from the input.<br>
<pre>        P&lt;BOTH&gt; = &lt;!GUARD-TERM&gt; &lt;ACTUAL-TERM&gt;;</pre>
This form of a phrase implements the same concept of a guarding
test, but in this case the parse of <tt>GUARD-TERM</tt> must
<em>fail</em> for the guard to allow parsing of this rule to
continue. (The '!' symbol should be read as 'not')<br/><br/>
(I added guards to an early parser of mine when I was a student around 1980,
after a theory lecture (I can't remember if it was by Les Valiant or
Rod Burstall) explaining P. J. Landin's work on guards in the context
of lambda calculus. All of which I've forgotten but the idea
of using them in a parser managed to stick.  Also the concept of
negative guards did come indirectly from Les Valiant who published
an article along the lines of "<a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82226226.pdf">Negation can be exponentially powerful</a>"&hellip; my 
take-away from his article &ndash; which I am 100% sure was not the
point he was making! &ndash; was that if you have a huge list of N options, rather than
test for N-1 of them which you want to match, you just test for the
one that you don't want to match and negate the result of that test.
Yes, that's a <em>Blinding Flash Of The Obvious</em> to some extent, but as a general
programming pattern which is often overlooked, that one stuck with me too!)
<h4>Built-in phrases</h4>
<p>In the old days, simply parsing the <tt>NAME</tt>s or numeric
constants in a language might have taken 25% of all the parsing
time (which could be minutes - who all remembers the routine correlation
between kicking off a build and going to make tea or coffee?!),
so a mechanism was added to allow some rules to be
implemented with built-in code rather than general phrase rules
which included a
long list of terminals containing all the letters of the alphabet. (This
was before the addition of regular expression
matching, which along with the use of  pre-compiled regular expressions,
speeded up the parsing of certain forms of terminal
considerably). In this parser, we do have the <em>built-in-phrase</em> (aka
<em>BIP</em>) mechanism, but it is not needed nearly as often as
was the case for 1970's compilers. There are a small number of BIPs
built-in to the parser, each one being assigned a fixed ID number.
When the programmer wants to use one of these BIPs he should
consult the source code and determine the appropriate number to use
for the specific function, for example:</p>
<pre>        B&lt;nl&gt; = 2;</pre>
which is implemented by this code to be found deep in the bowels of
the main parser code:
<pre>
        case 2: { // nl
          if (source(*TP) == '\n') {
            if (debug_parser) fprintf(stderr, "BIP: nl (Matched)\n");
            (*TP)++;
            return literal_descriptor(InitialTP, *TP);
          } else {
            if (debug_parser) fprintf(stderr, "BIP: nl (No match)\n");
            return 0;
          }
        }
      </pre>
The <tt>&lt;nl&gt;</tt> would match against the end of lines in the
source file. The most useful BIP that cannot be implemented more
simply using a terminal is EOF which checks for the end of the
source file and fails if there is more input present &ndash; although
having just said that, it occurs to me just now that (as long as I
have implemented the regular expression code correctly!) EOF could
be defined by:<br>
<pre>
        P&lt;any&gt; = &#171;.&#187;;
        P&lt;EOF&gt; = &lt;!any&gt;;
      </pre>
You should consider using either regular expressions, or parse-time
code as described below, as a substitute for BIPs in new code. Any
new BIPs you do create should be added to the base code of the
parser to be made available to other grammars.
<h4>Parse-time actions</h4>
<p>You might think the guard phrases above would allow you to
modify the parse as it happens, for instance by testing whether a
variable whose name had just been parsed was a <u>Boolean</u> or an
<u>integer</u> variable, so that the parser would allow a different
set of operators (e.g. AND and OR) to be used on operations between
Booleans as opposed to arithmetic operations (PLUS, MINUS) on
integers. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Because the entire
source is parsed and built into a tree before the users code ever
sees the output from the parser, it is too late to make parsing
decisions based on the results of earlier syntax recognition in
this way. However there <em>is</em> a mechanism which does exactly
what you want in these circumstances &hellip; but it has to be used
carefully:</p>
<p>Parse-time rules (or phrases) are sometimes called <em>semantic</em>
rules (or phrases) because normal rules just check the <em>syntax</em>
of your text, but these phrases which execute code as your
source is being parsed check the <em>semantics</em> of your text.</p>
<p>Parse-time rules have to be implemented with C code that is
embedded within the grammar file. Here is a very small example
which sets a run-time flag in one part of the parse and tests it in
another. Pay especial attention to the extra rule added to the
<em>following</em> alternative which undoes the run-time action in
the event of a failed alternative.<br>
In this trivial example, we will access a &lt;NAME&gt; but set a
flag according to whether the NAME was capitalised or not, then
when we use that name, we'll behave differently depending on
whether it was capitalised or not: we will not allow subtraction in
expressions if the immediately-preceding &lt;NAME&gt; was
capitalised!</p>
<pre>
        C&lt;set-flag&gt; = {
          flag = TRUE;
          return TRUE;
        };
        C&lt;clear-flag&gt; = {
          flag = FALSE;
          return TRUE;
        };
        C&lt;flag&gt; = {
          if (flag) return TRUE; else return FALSE;
        }
        P&lt;EXPR&gt; = &lt;NAME&gt; &lt;OP&gt; &lt;NAME&gt;;
        P&lt;OP&gt; = "*", "/", &lt;!flag&gt; "-", "+";
        P&lt;NAME&gt; = &lt;set-flag&gt;&#171;[A-Z][A-Za-z0-9]*&#187;, &lt;clear-flag&gt;&#171;[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9]*&#187;
</pre>
Note that it is a current but temporary restriction that <tt>C&lt;&hellip;&gt;</tt> phrases must
be defined in the grammar file before they are used.
<br/>
I will say this once more just in case your eyes have glazed over already - the
code in parse-time phrases is executed <em>as the text is parsed</em> and if present
in a rule will have executed at that time <em>even if that rule subsequently fails</em> due to
the following terms in the alternative.  Parse-time code is <b>not</b> the same as the code
in your main <tt>.c</tt> file which is executed only after a successful parse of
the entire input.  This is a critical distinction that you must appreciate before
writing any semantic phrases using the <tt>C&lt;&hellip;&gt;</tt> construct.  In fact it's
a construct that should only be used by advanced experts in parsing, as a mistake
in the use of that code will cause extremely confusing consequences.  You have
been warned!<br/><br/>
Your semantic-phrase code may require some new shared variables to be
created&hellip; or some helper procedures.  These can be added by
simply including a block of C code in the grammar file, surrounded
by {} brackets.  Note that the code will be inserted at the outer level,
i.e. not within any procedure, so the block must consist only of
data and procedure declarations &ndash; i.e. no imperative code.
<p>Finally, the grammar file is terminated with an 'E'
command:<br></p>
<pre>        E</pre>
<h4>Embedded grammars</h4>
The quickest way to develop a new language using this parser is to
simply create a <tt><em>language</em>.g</tt> file and build an
executable using the supplied Makefile. The executable acts as a
syntax checker for the given language. However to do more with the
parser, i.e. compile a program in some language or translate it to
another language, you need to start writing code to act on the
Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) generated by the parser. The easiest way
to do this is to embed the grammar in the same code as the
compiler. We do this by marking grammar rules in the source file
with the comment delimiter <tt>//\\</tt>. For example, this code is
from the Imp to C translator:<br>
<pre>
      case P_CONST_EXPR: //\\ P&lt;CONST-EXPR&gt; = &lt;const-guard&gt; &lt;EXPR&gt; &lt;cancel-const-guard&gt; ;
      {
        int expr = compile_expression(child(P,2), -1, VALUE_WANTED);
        constval = IntConstant_c(expr);
        if (constval == -1) {
          if (AstOP(expr) != C_CONST_STRING) {
            warn("%s is not an integer constant", SOURCE(P,2));
          }
          return expr;
        }
        return constval;
      }        
    </pre>
<p>The entire grammar must be present in the source file, commented
in this fashion. The grammar file can be extracted from these
embedded comments using any convenient utility on the host system
such such as:<br></p>
<pre>      sed -ne 's|\(.*\)//\\\\ \(.*\)|\2|gp' <em>language</em>.g</pre>
<p>The precise details of how the programmer's C code accesses the
parse tree and the parsed text attached to that tree will be given
in a later revision of this document. For now I will just mention
that the matched text is returned as a pair of pointers to the
start and end of that text within the source file, rather than as
an explicit string. In this way, two consecutive matches could be
concatenated very simply by returning a pair of start-pointer from
the first match and end-pointer from the second match. The use of a
string descriptor like this also allows the possibility of mapping
the source file to a virtual memory address and accessing the
source directly, thus avoiding the need to read the source and
store it in an array. However intermediate storage may still be
required if the language is of the type where keywords are
stropped: the easiest way to support stropping is by having a 'line
reconstruction' phase where stropped text is converted to a
different representation on input. Line reconstruction can also be
applied to languages such as C which do not have stropped keywords
(to canonicalise white space for example, or remove <tt>/* comments
*/</tt> between tokens) but this is seldom wanted, especially in
source-to-source translators where all text is of interest and
should be preserved in the translated output.</p>
<p>A closely related issue concerning internal text representation
is that the parser stores all characters (or more precisely,
Unicode code points) in 32-bit wint_t variables. In other words, we
convert UTF-8 text to UTF-32 format on input (and generate UTF-8
again on output). This simplifies some of the internal code
considerably &ndash; for example matching a single character in a regular
expression) but does unfortunately force us to read the entire
source file into an array of 32-bit integers rather than allowing
the direct memory-mapped access as suggested in the paragraph
above. For this reason we have not yet implemented memory-mapped
source file access, and the string descriptors passed around as the
result of a successful parse therefore are indexes into this
source[] array rather than pointers to the actual characters in the
source file.</p>
<h4>Efficiency of grammar rules</h4>
<p>In the early days of parsers in this style, the parser generator
itself would look for common prefixes in alternatives and attempt
to factor them out at a character level so that the parser would
never need to backtrack unnecessarily. In terms a programmer would
recognise, it formed a trie from the terminals acceptable at any
point in the grammar. For instance if the grammar allowed either
the word "<u>comment</u>" or the word "<u>continue</u>" at some
point, it would (invisibly to the programmer) factor the choice out
into "<u>co</u>" followed by a choice between "<u>mment</u>" and
"<u>ntinue</u>". We do not do this. The small amount of
backtracking that this saves is computationally irrelevant.
Similarly the advice used to be that the programmer should
explicitly factor higher level phrases within the grammar in a
similar way to achieve efficient parsing. Unless the backtracking
is significant, we do not recommend factoring out common terms if
doing so makes the grammar harder to understand.</p>
<h4>EBNF? Nein Danke!</h4>
<p>Some parsers support Extended BNF grammars which use syntactic
sugar to write more concise rules. We don't. The basic mechanisms
described above are sufficient to describe any construct we need,
albeit slightly more verbosely, and the syntax for referring
to the matched text with one of these extended rules is not obvious.
Whereas with a simple sequential list of phrases or terminals in an
alternative, you can access the parsed text from your program with simple
calls such as Phrase(2) or Terminal(3), where the number is simply
the index of that term within the sequence for that alternative.</p>
<p>To see how we would describe various grammar items using our
simplified syntax, let's look at an example where we would like to
define a parameter list as a comma-separated list of names.</p>
<p>Typical EBNF extensions could use syntax similar to any of these
examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>{ &hellip; }</tt> for an optional item.<br></li>
<li><tt>[ &hellip; ]</tt> for an optional item.<br></li>
<li><tt>( &hellip; )?</tt> for an optional item.<br></li>
<li><tt>?</tt> for an optional item.<br></li>
<li><tt>{ &hellip; }*</tt> for 0 or more items.<br></li>
<li><tt>[ &hellip; ]*</tt> for 1 or more items.<br></li>
<li><tt>( &hellip; )+</tt> for 1 or more items.<br></li>
<li><tt>*</tt> for repeating the last item.<br></li>
<li><tt>*</tt> for repeating the entire preceding alt.<br></li>
</ul>
(reminder: none of the above are supported in our grammars) Let's
look at an example using "( &hellip; )*" to define 0 or more repeats:
<pre>
       P&lt;PARAM-LIST&gt; = &lt;NAME&gt;  ("," &lt;NAME&gt; )* ;
    </pre>
In our grammars, you'll need to expand the rule as follows:
<pre>
      P&lt;PARAM-LIST&gt; = &lt;NAME&gt; &lt;REST-OF-PARAM-LIST&gt;;
      P&lt;REST-OF-PARAM-LIST&gt; = "," &lt;NAME&gt; &lt;REST-OF-PARAM-LIST&gt;, ;
    </pre>
Note that the recursive call <tt>REST-OF-PARAM-LIST</tt> must
follow other non-null phrases otherwise there will be infinite
recursion. This type of grammar is called 'right recursive'. Many
other parsers with which you may be familiar rely on grammars which
are written to be 'left recursive'. Please bear this in mind when
converting a grammar description from some other system to work
with this parser generator. The classic problem you should look out
for is something very roughly along the lines of this
left-recursive definition, which would cause an infinite loop:
<pre>
      P&lt;EXPR&gt; = &lt;REST-OF-EXPR&gt; &lt;TERM&gt;;
      P&lt;REST-OF-EXPR&gt; = &lt;EXPR&gt; &lt;OP&gt;, ;
    </pre>
as opposed to the right-recursive version, which should work:
<pre>
      P&lt;EXPR&gt; = &lt;TERM&gt; &lt;REST-OF-EXPR&gt;;
      P&lt;REST-OF-EXPR&gt; = &lt;OP&gt; &lt;EXPR&gt;, ;
    </pre>
<p>The parser generator actually detects such loops and considers
them to be errors, as well as warning the user about phrases which
are never invoked if starting from P&lt;SS&gt;.
</p>
<p>There are a small subset of runaway recursions caused by
grammar loops which are not currently detected - those are ones
where there is a terminal in the path of the loop.  The code
here assumes all terminals will match some text, but it *is*
possible (deliberately or in error) for a terminal to succeed
without matching any text.  However these errors will still
be detected - only they are detected at runtime, not while
building the tables.  It is possible that in the future such
hidden loops can also be warned about by takeon, if takeon
compiles the regular expressions and tries to match them
against an empty string.  This has not yet been implemented.
</p>
<p>Another common extension is an optional item, e.g.</p>
<pre>
      P&lt;TERM&gt; = &lt;NAME&gt; "++"?;
    </pre>
or sometimes
<pre>
      P&lt;TERM&gt; = &lt;NAME&gt; {"++"};
    </pre>
In our grammars, the optional term should be created as a rule with
a null alternative, i.e.:
<pre>
      P&lt;TERM&gt; = &lt;NAME&gt; &lt;plusplus_opt&gt;;
      P&lt;plusplus_opt&gt; = "++", ;
    </pre>
or if you prefer, a slightly more verbose version to be used if you
also need to use the non-optional version somewhere in your grammar
as well:
<pre>
      P&lt;TERM&gt; = &lt;NAME&gt; &lt;plusplus_opt&gt;;
      P&lt;plusplus&gt; = "++";
      P&lt;plusplus_opt&gt; = &lt;plusplus&gt;, ;
    </pre>
People familiar with systems where a '?' suffix denotes an optional
item should take a minute to appreciate the difference between a
hypothetical <tt>&lt;TERM?&gt;</tt> and our <tt>&lt;?TERM&gt;</tt>.
The former is an optional item which may match the given
<tt>TERM</tt> phrase or may match an empty string, and the latter
is a guard which must be matched, but which does not advance the
text pointer.
<p>A BNF extension to support 1 or more repeats (as opposed to the
example above of 0 or more repeats) is constructed in a similar
fashion. I'll leave this one as the traditional <em>exercise for
the reader</em> to give you a chance to put what you've read into
practice. If you can't work out the equivalent of this construct
using basic BNF then you're probably not ready yet to start writing
your own grammars:</p>
<pre>
      P&lt;TWO-PARAM-LIST&gt; = &lt;NAME&gt;  ["," &lt;NAME&gt; ]* ;
    </pre>
or maybe you might be more familiar with syntax like this, with the
same meaning:
<pre>
      P&lt;TWO-PARAM-LIST&gt; = &lt;NAME&gt;  ("," &lt;NAME&gt; )+ ;
    </pre>
<p>If you are having difficulty debugging a new rule set, try running the
generated program with either of these options:<br/><br/>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-dp</tt>: debug the parse<br/>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-dc</tt>: debug the completion stage, i.e. see how far the parse got.<br/><br/>
  The <tt>-dc</tt> option simply outputs the source text as it is parsed,
  to the diagnostic stream, so that you can see where the parse might be failing.
  This is also useful with a working compiler to determine what it is in your
  input file is not being accepted.  Note that the normal output from an error
  while parsing is a line number and column in a format that is compatible with
  'compile mode' in Emacs, so you can use Emacs' "M-x compile" command to
  invoke your parser and step to the next error. (We recommend setting: <tt>(setq-default compilation-auto-jump-to-first-error 1)</tt> in your ~/.emacs file)<br/>
  The <tt>-dp</tt> option documents in full the attempt to parse, including
  blind alleys that were tried and failed.  The tracing information can be somewhat voluminous and
  we recommend outputting the trace to a file for easier comprehension, e.g.
  by <tt>./algol60 badprog.a60 2> badprog.log</tt>
</p>
<h4>Grammar loops and other errors</h4>
<p>The table-builder, <tt>takeon</tt>, includes several internal consistency
  checks of your grammar.  These checks will detect phrase definitions which
  would otherwise lead to infinite loops when parsing. Detecting these is
  more complex than you might guess, and relies on performing a transitive
  closure of the phrases referenced by other phrases and an understanding
  by the grammar converter of nullable phrases, i.e. phrases which can
  return success without matching any text in the user's input.  Previous
  parsers in this style from Edinburgh did not include these checks - the
  grammar authors were presumed to be smart enough that they never made
  that kind of mistake :-)  However given that users of this package may
  come from prior experience with left-recursive grammars (usually because
  their parsers work bottom-up) I thought it wise to offer these safety
  features, especially as people frequently start from someone else's
  grammar file and if they have to convert a left-recursive grammar into
  the right-recursive style that this parser requires, the chances of a
  loop happening by accident while developing the grammar are quite high!
  It's a lot nicer for the developer to be told of a grammar loop while
  working on the grammar than to wait until the product is in the hands
  of the users and the loop is only detected at runtime and only for some
  specific and obscure input that only one user ever creates!
</p>
<p>Here are a sample of the error messages output by <tt>takeon</tt>.
I do intend to report the line number where the error is detected,
  but that will not be for a day or two.  The error format should be
compatible with <em><tt>compile mode</tt></em> in Emacs.</p>
<pre>
gtoal@linux:~/src/unicode$ ./takeon grammar-tests/unused.g &gt; /dev/null

</pre>
Here's a real-life example that was found in my grammar for Atlas Autocode:
<pre>
P&lt;plus-opt> =
    '+','-',
    ;

P&lt;exprn>=
    &lt;operand>&lt;rest_of_exprn>;

P&lt;rest_of_exprn> =
    &lt;operator>&lt;operand>&lt;rest_of_exprn>,
    ;

P&lt;operand> =
    &lt;name>&lt;actual_parameters>,
    &lt;const>,
    '('&lt;plus-opt>&lt;exprn>')',
    &lt;plus-opt>&lt;exprn>,
    ;
</pre>
which was reported as:<br/>
<pre>* Error: P&lt;operand> can left-recurse indirectly through &lt;rest_of_exprn></pre>

&hellip; Parsing an &lt;operand> resolved into parsing a &lt;plus-opt> followed by an &lt;exprn>.  The &lt;plus-opt> could be null,
and the &lt;exprn> in turned called &lt;operand> and thus would loop indefinitely without consuming any characters.  The fact that
&lt;operand> also had an unwanted null option was just the cherry on the cake :-(
<h4>EMACS support</h4>
I'm not very practised in Emacs Lisp and I'm sure this can be done better, but on the principle of something being better than
nothing, here's an elisp file you can add to your <tt>~/.emacs</tt> startup file to provide syntax highlighting for the <tt>.g</tt> grammar
files: <a href="gtbnf.el">gtbnf.el</a>  Possibly the most useful feature of the script is that it highlights rules with null alternatives, i.e. a trailing "<tt><font color="red">, ;</font></tt>"<br/>
(The limitation of this script is that it doesn't handle embedded C code very well. The BNF part looks fine however.)

  Although this page is here to talk about the general purpose parser I wrote, I suspect a few people may end up here
  more for the Algol 60 content.  So for you, here are a couple of things that may be of interest&hellip;<br/><br/>
  I use an old-school command-line editor for any editing that isn't trivial - it's called Ecce and came from
  Edinburgh in the 60's - indeed the same era as Algol 60.  However it's now past 2020, and we use screen editors
  most of the time.  So &hellip; I came up with a way to embed the Ecce command line within Emacs, so that trivial
  editing is done on-screen but complex work can be done with an Ecce command line simply by typing Control-E to
  invoke it.  Also, Emacs allows user-written syntax highlighting as well as keyboard shortcuts for symbols used
  in Algol 60 such as '&le;', not to mention <u>underlined</u> keywords, so I've written some e-Lisp to perform
  syntax highlighting and to assist in keyboarding characters that would otherwise not be available.  You can see some of this in action
  at <a href="https://gtoal.com/recordings/algol-editing.html">https://gtoal.com/recordings/algol-editing.html</a> (although
  you may need to shrink the page or just scroll down so that you can see the Ecce commands being entered at the bottom of the screen).
  My ".emacs" file is online here at <a href="http:/www.gtoal.com/src/DOTemacs.txt">http:/www.gtoal.com/src/DOTemacs.txt</a>.
  You may also want Ecce which you can download at <a href="https://ecce.sourceforge.net/ecce.c">https://ecce.sourceforge.net/ecce.c</a> although as of today (27th Jul 2023) I haven't updated
  that source with the new 'z' command (that adds Unicode underlining to letters) which is under development.  I'll do
  so after the new feature has been extensively tested - the Ecce release is very stable and I don't want to risk breaking
  it.  Ecce documentation is at <a href="https://ecce.sourceforge.net/manual.html">https://ecce.sourceforge.net/manual.html</a>
  with an online demo and a very brief introduction at <a href="https://ecce.sourceforge.net/tutorial.html">https://ecce.sourceforge.net/tutorial.html</a>

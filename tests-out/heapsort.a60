   c̲o̲m̲m̲e̲n̲t̲ This example doesn't work with marst 2.1 because of incorrect
     passing a formal parameter called by name to other procedure (but
     it does work with marst 2.2). This example program was reported by

   c̲o̲m̲m̲e̲n̲t̲ The following procedures are related to TREESORT
     [R. W. Floyd, Alg. 113, Comm. ACM 5 (Aug. 1962), 434, and
     A. F. Kaupe, Jr., Alg. 143 and and 144, Comm. ACM 5 (Dec. 1962),
     604] but avoid the use of pointers and so preserve storage space.
     All the procedures operate on single word items, stored as
     elements 1 to n of the array A. The elements are normally so
     arranged that A[i] <= A[j] for 2 <= j <= n, i = j % 2. Such an
     arrangement will be called a heap. A[1] is always the least
     element of the heap.
     The procedure SETHEAP arranges n elements as a heap, INHEAP
     adds a new element to an existing heap, OUTHEAP extracts the
     least element from a heap, and SWOPHEAP is effectively the
     result of INHEAP followed by OUTHEAP. In all cases the array A
     contains elements arranged as a heap on exit.
     SWOPHEAP is essentially the same as the tournament sort
     described by K. E. Iverson - A Programming Language, 1962,
     pp. 223--226 - which is a top to bottom method, but it uses an
     improved storage allocation and initialisation. INHEAP resembles
     TREESORT in being a bottom to top method. HEAPSORT can thus be
     considered as a marriage of these two methods.
     The procedures may be used for replacement-selection
     sorting, for sorting the elements of an array, or for choosing
     the current minimum of any set of items to which new items are
     added from time to time. The procedures are the more useful
     because the active elements of the array are maintained densely
     packed, as elements A[1] to A[n];

        c̲o̲m̲m̲e̲n̲t̲ SWOPHEAP is given an array A, elements A[1] to A[n]
        forming a heap, n >= 0. SWOPHEAP effectively adds the element in
        to the heap, extracts ans assigns to out the value of the least
        member of the resulting set, and leaves the remaining elements
        in a heap of the original size. In this process elements 1 to
        (n + 1) of the array A may be disturbed. The maximum number of
        repetitions of the cycle labeled scan is log_2 n;
